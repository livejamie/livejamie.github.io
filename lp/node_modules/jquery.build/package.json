Contains no browser version sniffing, only capability testing.\n* Good set of tests that can be run from either browsers or node.js.\n* MIT Licensed.\n\n##Example syntax:\n```javascript\n    var $b = $.build;\n\t  var elem = $b(\"#usernameWrapper\", [\n  \t\t$b(\"label[for=username]\", \"Enter your username\"),\n  \t\t$b(\"input#username[type=text]\"),\n  \t\t$b(\"button[type=button]\", \"Save\")\n  \t\t  .click(function (){\n  \t\t    alert(\"hey\");\n  \t\t  })\n\t  ]);\n```\nThis generates a jQuery wrapped DOM node in the elem variable with the HTML content:\n```html\n    <div id=\"usernameWrapper\">\n      <label for=\"username\">Enter your username</label>\n      <input id=\"username\" type=\"text\">\n      <button type=\"button\">Save<button>\n    </div>\n```\nAdditionally, the button element has a click handler bound to to it.\n\nThe return of each call to $.build is a jQuery object, which makes all kinds of fun function chaining possible.  This is an overly simple example, though, and doesn't show much of the power and flexibility of the syntax.  For more in-depth code samples and use cases see the examples and tests folders.\n\n##Using in the browser\n 1. Make sure you have jQuery inlcuded on your page\n 2. Include a `<script src=\"/your/path/to/jquery.build.js\"></script>`\n 3. The jQuery.build function can be accessed from then on.\n For an example, see `/examples/simple.html`\n \n##Using inside of Node.js    \n\nThis can be run server-side in node.js when used with a dom implmentation like jsdom.  Take a look at the tests for an example of doing this.\n\nYou can install with `npm install jquery.build`\nYou can run the tests with `grunt test`\n\n##History:\nI fell in love with the Builder.node syntax back in 2007.  Since then I've written several versions of node builders for different JS frameworks.  This is the one that I've eventually settled on as being my go-to way for creating markup from JavaScript.  I find it preferable to templating solutions, as it can intermingled with code in a way that is difficult to do with templates.\n\n##License:\nCopyright (c) 2011 Ian Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
